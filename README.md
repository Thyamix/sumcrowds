# Sumcrowds Monorepo

## What is Sumcrowds?

[Sumcrowds](https://sumcrowds.com) is a real-time event attendance counter. It was designed to help the volunteers of a local music festival keep track of attendance and ensure it did not exceed the legal capacity of the venue. Unfortunately, the festival ended up getting canceled.

## How does it work?

The app uses a session code to sync users to events. When a session is created, a random 6-character code is generated, which others can use to join. Each session is password protected, with an additional PIN required for access to the admin panel.
